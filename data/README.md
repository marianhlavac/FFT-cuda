**Sets of data used for the FFT algorithm.**

They are categorized to folders, depending on inner data. (Folder `50Hz` means there is a 50Hz sinusoid inside the data)

Inside the folders are the data files. The name represents sample count and sample rate. (eg. `8192smp@22050.dat` means there are 8192 samples inside, sampled with 22050Hz sample rate)
